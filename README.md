# Global-Political-Stability-and-Violence-Risk-Analysis-
Analysis of global political stability and violence risk using World Bank governance indicators, combining Python-based EDA with an interactive Power BI dashboard.

#Project Overview
Political stability and the absence of violence are critical for economic development, governance quality, and investment confidence. This project analyzes global political stability trends and violence risk using governance indicators published by the World Bank.

The analysis combines Python-based data exploration with an interactive Power BI dashboard to identify long-term trends, cross-country differences, and short-term volatility—particularly among the world’s most populous countries.

#Data Source
Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)
Indicator: Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism
Score range: approximately –2.5 (low stability, high violence risk) to +2.5 (high stability, low violence risk)
Lower scores indicate a higher perceived likelihood of politically motivated violence, terrorism, and instability.

#Key Questions
Has global political stability improved or declined over time?
How does political stability vary across countries?
How are countries distributed across stability categories?
How do the world’s most populous countries compare in long-term trends and year-over-year volatility?

#Key Insights
Global political stability has declined over the long term, suggesting rising instability and violence risk.
Political stability is unevenly distributed, with most countries clustered in moderate to low stability ranges.
A small group of countries remains consistently stable, while others face persistent instability.
Highly populated countries exhibit notable year-over-year volatility, even when long-term trends appear stable.

#Methodology
Data cleaning and preparation using Python (Pandas)
Feature engineering including year-over-year (YoY) change
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and distributions
Interactive visualization using Power BI
Detailed EDA, methodology, and interpretations are documented in the project notebook and report.

#Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard contains two pages:
Global Overview — long-term trends and country rankings
High-Population Country Focus — trend and YoY analysis for the world’s most populous countries

#Limitations
The indicator reflects perceived risk, not actual violent event counts.
Country-level aggregation may mask regional or local instability.
The analysis identifies trends and patterns but does not establish causality.

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates how governance indicators can be used to assess political stability and violence risk at both global and country levels. By combining long-term trends with short-term volatility analysis, the project highlights persistent instability patterns and emerging risks relevant to policy and risk assessment.
